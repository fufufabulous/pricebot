Effective date: 02/09/2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the Price Bot (“the Bot”) handles data.

1. Data We Collect

The Bot does not collect or store personal data such as names, emails, or messages.

The only information processed is:

Discord User IDs (when a command is run, for technical purposes only; not stored permanently).

Public cryptocurrency market data retrieved from third-party APIs (e.g., CoinMarketCap).

2. Data Storage

No personal user data is stored in any database.

Temporary data (like command context) is erased immediately after execution.

3. Sharing of Data

No data is shared with third parties.

Market data comes from trusted external APIs but no user information is sent to them.

4. User Rights

Users may contact the developer to request deletion of any server-related data (if logs exist).

Since the Bot does not store user data, there is typically nothing to delete.

5. Updates

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The latest version will always be available at this link.
